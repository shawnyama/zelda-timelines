# Zelda timelines

The Legend of Zelda franchise consists of various games. Each game can be enjoyed as a standalone experience. However those who played multiple titles might notice the games referencing each other from obvious to subtle ways. Fans that find satisfaction in contemplating and theorizing about Zelda lore and mythos came up with various arrangements that place the games in a chronology. This site is an interactive collection of Zelda timelines that provides an easy way to visualize, absorb and compare the timelines all in one place. Perhaps new conclusions can be made?

The timelines only include games mentioned in these sources in case you are wondering why some game(s) may be missing. If I come across other timeline theories I'll be interested in adding them too.
