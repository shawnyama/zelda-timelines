    <meta name="description" content="The Legend of Zelda franchise consists of various games. Each game can be enjoyed as a standalone experience. However those who played multiple titles might notice the games referencing each other from obvious to subtle ways. Fans that find satisfaction in contemplating and theorizing about Zelda lore and mythos came up with various arrangements that place the games in a chronology.
